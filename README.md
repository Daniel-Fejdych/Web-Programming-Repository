# Web-Programming-Repository
This repository will be the space where I, Daniel Fejdych, will publicly store my HTML/CSS/JS projects.
I will put anything I wish to publicly display in this repository.

In the first few weeks, I experimented with writing html, css and js, after which I forked the JQuery open-source project into a new repository on 12/10/23.
I will plan on creating multiple folders to organise my projects, each with the correct DOM structure.
I do not give permission to use this code without contacting me at df2017@hw.ac.uk.

## How To Use
This repository is split into segments, each of which includes a specific project of mine. The project files will have their own READMEs to guide you how to use each one. The structure will conform to standards a mentioned previously.
